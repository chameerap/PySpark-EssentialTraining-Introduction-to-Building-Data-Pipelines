PySpark Essential Training Introduction to Building Data Pipelines

**Course Overview**

PySpark extends the power of Apache Spark’s distributed computing framework to Python, enabling fast and scalable processing of large datasets. In this guides you through a practical, step-by-step introduction to PySpark. You’ll begin by exploring the fundamentals of Apache Spark—its architecture, components, and how it fits within the modern data ecosystem.

The course covers essential Spark concepts including the DataFrame API, transformations, actions, and lazy evaluation. You will also learn how to set up a working environment and apply your skills using real-world datasets. Additionally, the course highlights how PySpark integrates into a broader data engineering landscape and outlines best practices for operating PySpark in production environments.
